# DBMS-Project
The Agriculture Product Review and Rating System(Agro-Point) project is used to maintain and organize information about various agriculture products. This database has both customer and product details. This Database is used to maintain customer reviews and ratings of the products. This project helps the customer to know about the products available, compare their ratings and ultimately select the product which suits them. This project is helpful in managing various aspects of agriculture products, including reviews, ratings, and customer feedback.

# Problem Statement
Farmers and other agriculture professionals donâ€™t have a reliable system to provide their feedback on a particular product. There is a lack of a feedback system in this domain. It is difficult for companies to get valuable feedback or suggestions on their products from farmers. The system companies follow right now is to have a physical survey of the product. This system has limitations as it can only receive a handful of reviews, is very expensive, and takes a lot of time.
